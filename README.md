Understanding Closure: <br/>
assume we have a function named outer, which contains a variable called counter and a callback function named incrementCounter.
how can we acces the counter globally? <br/>
Here, it reminds us Closures, and its usage is as illustrated in the visuals.

and after that we can use debugger to see we have access to counter globally: <br/>
in first myNewFunction() increment counter 0 to 1;
and second myNewFunction() increment counter 1 to 2; <br/>
